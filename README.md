# CNN_Tree_Classification
Experiments of CNN using datasets of TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive.

## Introduction
This is an AI project using Python, conducted by Soichiro Tanabe based on the studies from the Open University module: 'AI and Machine Learning'.

## Data Sources
Zenodo ([available from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6780578))

## Research Objectives

1. Investigate CNN model performance in forest classification.
2. Assess the impact of changing CNN models and modifying datasets.
3. Compare tree species prediction accuracy between different CNN models.
4. Examine performance differences between two classification levels (Level 1 and Level 2).

## Material 

- `Level_1`: Jupyter notebook file and PDF
- `Level_2`: Jupyter notebook file and PDF
- `Report.pdf`
